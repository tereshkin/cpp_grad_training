1. Make sure that basket_4 example works for every product type
2. Change seller to be usable directly in 'total_weight' function
3. Overload 'std::cout <<' for basket_4 and use it in main
4. Add product which is measured by number of things only ('int' storage type)

5. Write number generators which by default produces binomial distribution for integer
   and normal distribution for double. Think about putting them as standalone functions
   or classes.
