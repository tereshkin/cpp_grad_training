This is collection of exercises and examples for my c++ lessons.

Each folder is a self-contained project which can be built using CMake.
Common process to build and run CMake project is:
1. mkdir build && cd build
2. cmake ..
3. cmake --build .
4. ./run

When you change the code and want to build your project only command (3) has to be used.
