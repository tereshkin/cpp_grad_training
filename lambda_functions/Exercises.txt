Try following:
 * Write lambda which finds minimum of 3 numbers
 * Think if you cna make this lamda work for any number type (int, double)
 * Use "power" lambda function inside this lamda to return square root

Exercise to use lambdas:
 * Create 2 vectors with some numbers
 * Using lambdas add numbers to the first vector only if they do not exist in the second

Exercise with template function:
 * Change transform vector to accept vector of any type

Perform following using standard library functions:
 * Count negative elements in your vector
 * Check if all numbers in the vector are power of 2 (do not use 'count')
 * Replace negative numbers in your vector with their index (position)

Filter exercise:
 * Change filter class to be usable via 'transform_vector' function
 * Change 'filer_result' inside transform to be a memebr function of the class
 * Add method to count number of "valid" arguments using this method and 'count_if'
